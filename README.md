## mux-server

Kind of playground for golang language. Thinking about creating several branches (or not) for:
1. Messaging API between users with Google OAUTH authentication.
2. Mail server.
3. TUI-powered chat over SSH.
4. Maybe some typing trainer.
5. gVisor wrapper to wrap any program's net interface into SOCKS proxy (like wirez but a bit useful).
6. God knows what else...
